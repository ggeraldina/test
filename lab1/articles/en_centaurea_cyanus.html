        <p>Centaurea cyanus, commonly known as cornflower or bachelor's button, 
        is an annual flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to Europe. 
        In the past it often grew as a weed in cornfields (in the broad sense 
        of the word "corn", referring to grains, such as wheat, barley, rye, 
        or oats), hence its name. It is now endangered in its native habitat 
        by agricultural intensification, particularly over-use of herbicides, 
        destroying its habitat. It is also, however, through introduction as 
        an ornamental plant in gardens and a seed contaminant in crop seeds, 
        now naturalised in many other parts of the world, including North 
        America and parts of Australia.</p>
        
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cornflower is an annual plant growing to 40–90 cm tall, with 
        grey-green branched stems. The leaves are lanceolate, 1–4 cm long. 
        The flowers are most commonly an intense blue colour, produced in 
        flowerheads (capitula) 1.5–3 cm diameter, with a ring of a few large, 
        spreading ray florets surrounding a central cluster of disc florets. 
        The blue pigment is protocyanin, which in roses is red. It flowers 
        all summer.</p>

        <p>Centaurea cyanus is native to temperate Europe, but is widely 
        naturalized outside its native range. It has been present in the 
        British Isles as an archaeophyte (ancient introduction) since the 
        Iron Age. In the United Kingdom it has declined from 264 sites to 
        just 3 sites in the last 50 years. In reaction to this, the 
        conservation charity Plantlife named it as one of 101 species it 
        would actively work to bring 'Back from the Brink'. In Ireland, 
        in Co.Clare (H9) Centaurea cyanus is recorded in arable fields as 
        very rare and almost extinct. while in the north-east of Ireland 
        it was abundant before 1930s.</p>
        
        <h2>Cultivation</h2>
        <p>It is grown as an ornamental plant in gardens, where several 
        cultivars have been selected with varying pastel colours, 
        including pink and purple. Cornflower is also grown for the 
        cutflower industry in Canada for use by florists. The most common 
        colour variety for this use is a doubled blue variety such as 
        'Blue Boy' or 'Blue Diadem'. White, pink, lavender and black 
        (actually a very dark maroon) are also used but less commonly. 
        A relative, Centaurea montana, is a perennial plant which is 
        also cultivated as a garden plant. Cornflowers germinate quickly 
        after planting.</p>
        <p>Light requirements: full sun. Water requirements: high-average 
        water daily. Soil pH requirements: neutral (6.6-7.5) to mildly 
        alkaline (7.6-7.8).</p>
